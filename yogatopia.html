<h4>UX Case Study</h4>

<div id="yogatopiacasestudy" class="container-fluid">
<h2 class="poppins">Original Hypothesis</h2>
<p>People struggle with what brand and version of a product they should buy, in store and online as there are too many choices<p>

<h2 class="poppins">Problem</h2>
<p>
Women’s main concern when shopping for clothing items is finding the exact size and fit. The models which display clothing are too tall and skinny and don’t give them a good idea of how the actual clothes will look on their own body.</p>

<h2 class="poppins">Solution</h2>
<p>While we can’t change the fashion retailing industry, Yogatopia is an app that connects users to yoga events.</p>
<p>Yoga and meditation will help users achieve positive body image, attend yoga events with like-minded people, and learn how they can accept themselves.</p>

<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>I conducted some secondary research to better understand my consumers' habits</p>
<img class="img-responsive" id="secondaryresearchyogatopia" src="photos/secondaryresearchyogatopia.png"/>
<p>I conducted a screener survey to get a better idea of my target user.</p>
<img class="img-responsive" id="screener" src="photos/screenersurvey.png"/>
<p id="interviews">I conducted 8 user interviews.  The results are documented in this affinity diagram</p>
<img class="img-responsive" id="affinitydiagram-2" src="photos/affinitydiagram-2.png"/>
<p id="persona">I craft a user persona named "Alex Smith"</p>
<img class="img-responsive" id="userpersona" src="photos/userpersona.png"/>

<div id="ideate">
<h2>Ideate</h2>
<p>What Needs To Be Done?</p>
<p>We can’t change the world and start demanding fashion retailers to implement normal sizing.  We also can’t tell the media and  advertising industry to tear down unhealthy-looking models.  We can create a platform where people can embrace yoga and meditation as part of a positive and healthy lifestyle.  This platform can help users embrace a culture of acceptance, instead of promoting eating disorders.</p>
