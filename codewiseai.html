<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a team of 4 UX/UI Design interns, we were tasked with working for a stealth-based AI client for our Industry Design Project. The client is looking for a fresh and appealing new UX/UI Design of his platform which allows software developers to access repositories from Github and connect with such apps. He also wants to make it easier for software development teams to work on code collaboratively.

The company is looking to re-design the Connected Apps page and Chat AI page. They want to implement a more minimalist and user-friendly design.<p>


<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Software development teams need a way to perform actions against their data, their code, which is stored on Github, Gitlab, Datadog, Splunk and much more. Software development teams need a way to centralize work that they do on code.</p>

<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Hassan Mahmood, Jon Brown, organizations who will subscribe for SAAS software.</p>


<h2>Market Research</h2>
<p>According to a research conducted by Blackberry Global Research, “49% of IT decision makers believe that ChatGPT will help hackers improve coding skills”.

Generative AI features such as ChatGPT help software development teams tackle work that would normally take more time and money.

According to a study by McKinsey, Generative AI will help developers not necessarily write better code, but speed up their work flow.

Generative AI solutions help development teams write difficult code, debugging, fix bugs, code completion, refactor code, document code, generate code snippets and explain difficult code techniques and concepts.

Often code need to be refactored or documented. Software development teams have to work fast to provide service to customers while at the same time documenting changes for future use. Being able to bookmark and document changes helps make future changes easier.

The solution helps expedite some more manual work and help developers get into the “flow” more quickly.

Having the tools and technology at developers’ fingertips will help them be more efficient with their work and stay focused.

This XYZ AI Company will create the next SAAS-based generative AI solution, which can be used in various companies as this is a sought out product feature of software development teams.</p>
